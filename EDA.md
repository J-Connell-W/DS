# Exploratory Data Analysis

As it stands now I am interested in learning Data Science as it is used in machine learning.
</br>
The steps below are only applicable after a data set has been gathered. Once there is a new data set we must "clean" the data set and make sure that it is in a usable state. This means we must remove columns if they are irrelevant, address outliers, handle missing values, and check for errors that may have been caused when entering the data. 
<br/>
Another step is to start to find out where relationships between variables may exist. 
<br/><br/>
The goal is to have the possibly messy and unrefined data set come to you; clean it by fixing the aforementioned problems, then output a data set that is useful for a model.
<br/><br/>
### Some definitions provided by gpt-4 I am curious if they are accurate. 
<br/>
<br/>
<h3> Data cleaning: </h3> 
<br/>
Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies in the data. This ensures that the model learns from accurate and consistent information.
<br/>
<br/>
### Feature engineering: 
</br>
Create new features or transform existing ones to better represent the underlying patterns in the data. This can help the model capture the relationships more effectively.
</br></br>
For my understanding I will add that it can include the acts of combining certain variables into one, and it is just overall manipulating the data into a usable form.
<br/><br/>
### Feature selection: 
</br>
Identify the most relevant features for the task at hand, which can help improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and speed up training.

<br/><br/>
### Scaling and normalization: 
</br>
Standardize the features so that they have similar scales and ranges, which can help some models converge faster and perform better.

<br/><br/>
### Encoding categorical variables: 
</br>
Convert categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding) that can be fed into the model.
<br/><br/>
### Handling imbalanced data sets: 
</br>
If the target variable has imbalanced classes, you might need to resample the data or use appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure that the model doesn't become biased towards the majority class.
